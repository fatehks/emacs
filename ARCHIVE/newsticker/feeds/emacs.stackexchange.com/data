            <p>I just installed Emacs 25.1 for windows.
I want to modify the TODO keyword list, and I use this code:</p>

<pre><code> (setq org-todo-keywords
  '((sequence \"TODO\"
      \"MAYBE\"
      \"NEXT\"
      \"STARTED\"
      \"WAITING\"
      \"DELEGATED\"
      \"|\"
      \"DONE\"
      \"DEFERRED\"
      \"CANCELLED\")))
</code></pre>

<p>However, the TODO items keep cycling between the standard keywords.
Strangely enough, if I check the variable 'org-todo-keywords from within the customization buffer, I do see all the keywords I've defined.</p>

<p>Any hints on why the do not appear when cycling?</p>

            <p>I have a working snippet that advices both kill-buffer and kill-this-buffer to not kill the <em>scratch</em> buffer:</p>

<pre><code>  (defun ninrod/scratch-bodyguard (buffer-assassin &amp;rest arguments)
    (let ((buffer-to-kill (buffer-name (current-buffer))))
      (if (equal buffer-to-kill \"*scratch*\")
          (message \"DENIED! don't kill my precious *scratch*!!\")
        (apply buffer-assassin arguments))))
  (defun ninrod/scratch-protection (buffer-assassin &amp;rest arguments)
    (let ((buffer-to-kill (car arguments)))
      (if (equal buffer-to-kill \"*scratch*\")
          (message \"DENIED! don't kill my precious *scratch*!!\")
        (apply buffer-assassin arguments))))
  (advice-add #'kill-this-buffer :around #'ninrod/scratch-bodyguard)
  (advice-add #'kill-buffer :around #'ninrod/scratch-protection)
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that these lines:</p>

<pre><code>  (message \"DENIED! don't kill my precious *scratch*!!\")
 (apply buffer-assassin arguments))))
</code></pre>

<p>Are repeated in both functions, so I thought that I could apply the DRY principle and refactor the snippet to this:</p>

<pre><code>(defun ninrod--protection (buffer-assassin buffer-to-kill &amp;rest arguments)
  (if (equal buffer-to-kill \"*scratch*\")
      (message \"DENIED! don't kill my precious *scratch*!!\")
    (apply buffer-assassin arguments)))
(defun ninrod/scratch-bodyguard (buffer-assassin &amp;rest arguments)
  (let ((buffer-to-kill (buffer-name (current-buffer))))
    (ninrod--protection 'buffer-assassin buffer-to-kill arguments)))
(defun ninrod/scratch-protection (buffer-assassin &amp;rest arguments)
  (let ((buffer-to-kill (car arguments)))
    (ninrod--protection 'buffer-assassin buffer-to-kill arguments)))
(advice-add #'kill-this-buffer :around #'ninrod/scratch-bodyguard)
(advice-add #'kill-buffer :around #'ninrod/scratch-protection)
</code></pre>

<p>This causes all hell to break loose. Now I can't even close emacs, because apparently emacs tries to kill all buffers
and as I've just tampered with the kill buffer functions, well, it's bad. Very bad.</p>

<p>I know I mean well, but I'm must be doing something very stupid. For starters, I don't know if I can really pass around
functions as parameters? So it could be that?</p>

<p>How would you refactor that snippet to apply the dry principle?</p>

<p>edit:</p>

<p>this works: </p>

<pre><code>(defun ninrod--protection (buffer-assassin buffer-to-kill &amp;rest arguments)
  (if (equal buffer-to-kill \"*scratch*\")
      (message \"DENIED! don't kill my precious *scratch*!!\")
    (apply buffer-assassin arguments)))

(defun ninrod/scratch-bodyguard (buffer-assassin &amp;rest arguments)
  (let ((buffer-to-kill (buffer-name (current-buffer))))
    (ninrod--protection 'buffer-assassin buffer-to-kill arguments)))

(advice-add #'kill-this-buffer :around #'ninrod/scratch-bodyguard)
</code></pre>

<p>so the problem lies exactly here:</p>

<pre><code>(defun ninrod/scratch-protection (buffer-assassin &amp;rest arguments)
  (let ((buffer-to-kill (car arguments)))
    (ninrod--protection 'buffer-assassin buffer-to-kill arguments)))
</code></pre>

<p>edit2: quoting or unquoting the function <code>buffer-assassin</code> does not make a difference</p>

            <p>If I load up emacs and go to my .emacs file (a fragment of which is given below), and I press SPC f or C-c C-f then it does find-file, which is the expected behaviour. However, if I type M-x eval-buffer, or load-file, suddenly SPC f doesn't work, but C-c C-f still does. If I press SPC, it just goes to the next character as it would without evil-leader. What gives?</p>

            <p>I'm not finding a lot of examples/documentation for the non-REPL world of C/C++ in Emacs org-mode babel. For example, is there a way to break a program up into separate source code blocks, i.e., a block for <code>main</code>, then separate blocks for its <code>func1</code>, <code>func2</code>, ... called by <code>main</code>? Or, is there any way to have just a stand-alone function <code>lonefunc</code> in a block, then call it from another place? I suppose this is all a form of literate programming, but typically you're pulling it all together with tangling. I'd like not to tangle, but have things running in the org-mode session.</p>

            <p>Most everyone who uses <code>paredit</code> has used <code>paredit-kill</code> (i.e., <code>C-k</code>), which allows one to delete a line forwards whilst keeping delimiters balanced properly. But how does one do this in the reverse direction? When one does <code>C-0 C-k</code>, <a href=\"http://emacsredux.com/blog/2013/04/08/kill-line-backward/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">which is something that's typically used to kill the line backwards</a>, <code>paredit-kill</code> actually calls the built-in <code>kill-line</code> to handle it. Unfortunately, this loses the delimiter-balancing that is otherwise had with <code>paredit-kill</code>. Since discovering that <code>C-0 C-k</code> does not work quite right, I've tried implementing a <code>paredit-backward-kill-line</code> function that will kill backwards <em>and</em> balance delimiters a la <code>paredit-kill</code>. However, I've not had much luck with this and have only come up with an implementation which uses <code>paredit-backward-delete</code> under certain conditions. This solution has only worked marginally well for me thus far. I've also tried reworking some of <code>paredit</code>'s functions that relate to killing lines, but it seems that they are all hard-coded to work with forwards deletion. This is making certain functions here significantly difficult to rework.</p>

<p>All in all, this seems like a lot of work to get something working that seems like it should be relatively simple, given that <code>paredit</code> already works as well as it does. So, I guess my question is: is there a way to do a backwards <code>paredit-kill</code> which retains all the delimiter-balancing functionality that is had from a normal, forwards <code>paredit-kill</code>?</p>

            <p><code>next-line</code> is very slow, and this is creating problems. I'll give some background then explain why.</p>

<p>By default, linum.el treats a wrapped line as a single line, and it takes into account hidden lines when numbering. I need it to number visual lines only - i.e. it should ignore hidden lines, and count wrapped lines as multiple lines.</p>

<p>For example, this is how it works by default:</p>

<pre><code>1 This is a line.
2 This is a long line which has been auto-wrapped
 &gt;by emacs.
3 This is another line.
</code></pre>

<p>This is the behaviour I want:</p>

<pre><code>1 This is a line.
2 This is a long line which has been auto-wrapped
3&gt;by emacs.
4 This is another line.
</code></pre>

<p>I have this behaviour working, but it's very slow. By default, linum.el uses <code>forward-line</code> to number each line. This is the code that actually moves down by one line and increments the line counter:</p>

<pre class=\"lang-el prettyprint-override\"><code>(let ((inhibit-point-motion-hooks t))
  (forward-line))
(setq line (1+ line))
</code></pre>

<p>I modified it to use <code>next-line</code>:</p>

<pre class=\"lang-el prettyprint-override\"><code>(let ((inhibit-point-motion-hooks t))
  ;; (forward-line)
  (next-line))
(setq line (1+ line))
</code></pre>

<p>This works, but <code>next-line</code> is very slow in comparison to <code>forward-line</code>. Line numbers must be updated frequently so this slows down Emacs considerably. </p>

<p>I don't actually <em>need</em> to number every line. I am happy to use <code>forward-line</code> and number only the beginning of lines, as so:</p>

<pre><code>1 This is a line.
2 This is a long line which has been auto-wrapped
 &gt;by emacs.
4 This is another line.
</code></pre>

<p>But if I want to do this, I need to be able to check how many <em>screen</em> lines I moved when I called <code>forward-line</code>.</p>

            <p>One usually adds entries to <code>org-publish-project-alist</code> to describe what and how needs to be published, including <code>:publishing-directory</code>, fancy <code>:publishing-function</code> and alike.

My problem is that I cannot wrap my head around how would I go about making it all flexible.</p>

<p>I'd like everything to go by a \"standard\" project name no matter what repository clone I'm in, i.e. if I have multiple cloned copies of my repository, I'd like to have same project name while exporting files from subfolders.

<p>It seems that <code>.dir-locals.el</code> is the way to go. But it is getting gnarly with on the fly evaluation of various path names, etc and I have to mark variable and values as safe.

<p>Is there a canonical way on how to achieve such setups in general?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>
Currently, I'm having a custom function that overrides quite many things (starting with looking up a working repository copy root containing <code>.git</code>) on a global scale with <code>setq</code> and this function is wrapped into a minor mode. It is still somewhat broken (autoload part) due to my knowledge (or lack thereof) of Elisp so I have to re-evaluate the file as some variables aren't set right. And a huge shortcoming is that I have to restart Emacs to get variables back to their original values as it is too many of them that I change (like <code>org-twbs-tag-class-prefix</code>, <code>org-twbs-format-headline-function</code>, <code>org-latex-classes</code>, <code>org-babel-default-header-args:dot</code> and more).</p>

I do C-x C-f /username@ftp.foo.com: (to get a dir listing) or :index.html (file exists), and in both cases emacs asks me for my password, I enter it, and then emacs freezes.  Hard freezes - only way to kill it is to use Task Manager, and kill two emacs-w32 processes.</p>

<p>I'm using the cygwin emacs-w32 program.</p>

<p>My .emacs includes (require 'cygwin-mount).  I also tried (require 'setup-cygwin) (downloaded most recent version today), but that doesn't load properly.  Error about \"cannot find cygwin\", having to do with a variable that sets the path to cygwin.  I couldn't figure it out so commented out (require 'setup-cygwin).</p>

<p>So - suggestions?  Could this relate to what ftp client emacs / ange-ftp is finding?  Other things about my emacs setup for cygwin?  I've been using cygwin emacs for about 6 months and most other things work, including running processes from within emacs (shell, tex, grep, diff, etc).</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>I want to implement behavior similar to mine vim config, where all basic info was below the main frame, like modes, position in file, changes, but above the frame is list of all buffers, with separated by color active buffer for active window. Is it possible to do somehow? thx. Can you suggest some plugins or scripts implementing similar behavior?</p>

<p>There are of course a lot of information about automating tasks, and creating macros in Emacs, but nothing about slowing their repetition.</p>
